In the dream, I was in a hospital.<div>I asked a nurse for a bed because I believed that I would be sick very soon.</div><div>"When will you be sick? Are you in pain now?" She asked.</div><div>"I am fine now, but I will have abdominal pain in about two hours", I replied.</div><div>"Come back when you are in pain." She refused my request.</div><div>So, I grabbed a book from a table and sat down in the room, waiting for my pain to come.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then,</div><div><br /></div><div>I woke up. It was 7 am.</div><div><br /></div><div>I ate my breakfast and everything seemed fine. I went to school and started the day by reading slides about Presentation programming.</div><div>Then, I felt pain around 10 am. </div><div><br /></div><div>My body does tell. I should listen more carefully.</div>
