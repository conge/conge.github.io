<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: small; "><div><div>【原文】</div></div><div><div>People believe themselves to be dependent on what happens for their happiness, that is to say, dependent on form. They don't realize that what happens is the most unstable thing in the universe. It changes constantly. They look upon the present moment as either marred by something that has happened and shouldn't have or as deficient because of something that has not happened but should have. And so they miss the deeper perfection that is inherent in life itself, a perfection that is always already here, that lies beyond what is happening or not happening, beyond form. Accept the present moment and find the perfection that is deeper than any form and untouched by time.</div><div><br /></div><div>The joy of Being, which is the only true happiness, cannot come to you through any form, possession, achievement, person or event -- through anything that happens. That joy cannot <i>come </i>to you -- ever. It emanates from the formless dimension within you, from consciousness itself and thus is one with who you are.</div><div>【译文】</div><div>人们认为自己的幸福依赖于发生在他们身上的事情，换句话说，<wbr>幸福依赖于某种形式上的东西。他们意识不到“<wbr>发生在他们身上的事”是宇宙中最不稳定的了。它们时刻在变动。而这些人们看待当下的态度也不外乎两种解释：当下有缺陷，要么是因为不该发生的事情发生了，要么就是该发生的却<wbr>没发生。这种对当下的态度，使得他们因而错失了那与生俱来的深度完美。这完美与任何形式上的事物无关，这完美一直存在。<wbr>接受当下并发现这比任何形式都有深度的且不为时间所动的完美吧。</div><div><br /></div><div>存在的喜悦是唯一真正的幸福，而且你不能通过任何形式，财产，成就，<wbr>人或者事来接触到它。任何事都不能引你到这种喜悦。<wbr>这喜悦不能，永远不能，自己降临到你的头上。它只会由内而外，<wbr>从你自身的无形之维度中，从意识当中发散出来。它同你浑然一体。</div><div><br /></div><div>【心得】</div></div><div>喜悦来自于内心。平和或者和平也一样。</div><div>人对自己有完全的接受，才会有喜悦。随心所欲，不为自己的“<wbr>理性”或者外界的影响改变自己的善良本性，才是达到喜悦极乐，<wbr>安静平和的状态。</div><div><br /></div></span>
