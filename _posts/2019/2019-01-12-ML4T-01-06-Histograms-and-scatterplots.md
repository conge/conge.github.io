# 01 - Histograms and scatterplots
![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-4c6c90f4c6b14a50.png)

* One of the most informative ways to consider __daily returns__ is when we compare the returns of one stock with another.

02 - A closer look at daily returns  
![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-18dd4c3d2936f90d.png)

* starting with a price time series.
* we build daily returns, this daily return data is not too revealing as time-series.

### histograms

* A histogram is a kind of bar chart where we plot the number of occurrences of each item versus the value.
* split up the range of data into lots of little bins.
* and count up how many times the data matches the range across that bin.
* a bar of the appropriate height in the histogram that represents how many times the data matched that value.

# 03 - Quiz What would it look like

What the histogram of S&P 500 daily return over many years look like?

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-260977e235a04b82.png)

The correct answer:  __bell curve__.

# 04 - Histogram of daily returns

Statistics we can run on it to characterize histograms.
* mean.
* standard deviation: how far do individual measurements deviate from the mean.
* Kurtosis (means curved or arching): it tells us about the tails of the distribution.
The measure of kurtosis tells us how much different our histogram from that traditional Gaussian distribution.
  * Positive Kurtosiswe indicate fat tails, Meaning that there are more occurrences out in these tails than would be expected if it were a normal distribution.
 * Negative kurtosis indicates __skinnytails__, meaning that there are many fewer occurrences than would be expected if it were a normal distribution on the tails.

# 05 - How to plot a histogram

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-20e7aacec2612fe2.png)

`daily_returns.hist(bin=20)` will plot daily_return as histogram with 20 bins. the default `bin` parameter is 10.

# 06 - Computing histogram statistics

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-3024d695a287e94c.png)
Calculate mea and deviation and kurtosis:
```
mean = daily_returns['SPY'].mean()
std = daily_returns['SPY'].std()
kurtosis = daily_returns.kurtosis()
```

Plot mean and diviation using `axvline()` in the Matplotlib library .
```
plt.axvline(mean, color='w', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)
plt.axvline(std, color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)
plt.axvline(-std, color='r', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)
plt.show()
```

* positive kurtosis for the SPY stock, which means we have fat tails.

* Note: `bincounts()` using `numpy.histogram` function.

# 07 - quiz: Compare two histograms
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-d49221b1274875d2.png)

__Quiz: Select the option that best describes the relationship between XYZ and SPY.__  

Note:
*   These are histograms of daily return values, i.e. X-axis is +/- change (%), and Y-axis is the number of occurrences.
*   We are considering two general properties indicated by the histogram for each stock: *return* and *volatility* (or risk).


__correct answer__: XYZ has a lower return and higher volatility than SPY.
* mean of XYZ, is lower than the mean of SPY.
* XYZ got a larger standard deviation (broader shoulders), therefore, higher volatility.

# 8 - Plot two histograms together

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-d4d870aeb7817418.png)

Since the daily_returns data frame has data for two stocks, `daily_returns.hist(bin=20)` will plot the data in two subplots.

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-a7b95e14e1ecbd17.png)

```
daily_returns['SPY'].hist(bin=20,label="SPY")
daily_returns['XOM'].hist(bin=20,label="XOM")
...
```
* To get two histograms on the same x and y axis, call the histogram functions separately on each of the stocks daily return values.
* also add the label parameter so that we can differentiate between the histogram of the SPY and XOM.

# 9 - Scatterplots
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-c5f4d817d9d44a64.png)

A scatterplot is another way to visualize the differences between daily returns of individual stocks. The left graph is daily return of two stocks. S&P 500 and XYZ.
* On a scatterplot, there are a number of individual points or dots represents the daily returns of two stocks that happened on a particular day.
* the dots are somewhat scattered. They don't form a perfect line.

# 10 - Fitting a line to data points
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-0b01cbbb89cba079.png)

* we can fit a line to it using linear regression.
* slope, in financial terminology, is usually referred to as __beta__ which means is how reactive is the stock to the market.
  * e.g. Beta = 1 then on average, when the market goes up 1%, that particular stock also goes up 1%.
  * if beta = 2, then if the market were to go up 1%, we'd expect on average for that stock to go up 2%.

* intercepts, also called alpha. Positive alpha means that this stock is actually on average performing a little bit better than the S&P 500 every day. If it's negative, it means on average it's returning a little bit less than the market overall.

# 11 - Slope does not equal correlation
![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-e4fab13dcca23841.png)

* The slope is no correlation.
* Correlation is a measure of how tightly do these individual points fit that line. the range of correlation is from 0 to 1.

# 12 - Quiz: Correlation vs slope
![quiz](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-6eec18602a51c640.png)

Select the option that best compares ABC against XYZ, in terms of beta (slope of linear fit) and correlation with the market (represented by SPY).



# 13 - Scatterplots in python

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-d8d4e4750d6836a2.png)
Key codes
```
daily_returns.plot(kind='scattr',x='SPY', y='XOM') # scatterplot 
beta_XOM,alpha_XOM=np.polyfit(daily_returns['SPY'],daily_returns['XOM'], 1)
plt.plot(daily_returns['SPY'],beta_XOM*daily_returns['SPY'] + alpha_XOM, '-',color='r')
plt.show()
```
* Kind parameter of the plot function of the data frame will help us plot scatterplots.
* NumPy's `ployfit()` function can fit a line to scatterplots and get alpha and beta of the regression line. the parameter "1" means the fitting is linear, y = mx + b.Here m is the coefficient and b is the intercept.

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-d413408850c7c16e.png)

* beta values for the XOM is greater as compared to that of GLD so that XOM is more reactive to market as compared to GLD.
* the alpha values denote how well it performs with respect to SPY and Numbers indicate that GLD performed better.

One last thing is to find the correlation yet again.

`daily_returns.corr(method='pearson')` will output in the correlation matrix with the correlation of each column with each other column.
* high correlation means the dots fit the line closely.

# 14 - Real world use of kurtosis
![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-61f7060c0091a351.png)

* the distribution of daily returns for stocks and the market looks very similar to a Gaussian.
* but it is dangerous to assume that financial returns are normal distributions because it ignores kurtosis or the probability in the tails.
* In the early 2000s investment banks built bonds based on mortgages and assumed that the distribution of returns for these mortgages was normally distributed.
* Their model failed because of the assumption of normal distribution
