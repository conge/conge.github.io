## Conundrums of AI

![Five Conundrums of AI](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-4daab6f2b45d5d2e.png)

* how AI agents give near real-time solutions with limited computation resources
* How local AI agent explore and address global constraints with local knowledge
* How deductive AIs solve abductive or inductive problems
* How can AI solve new problems with limited knowledge
* How we get AI to explain justifications

## Characteristics of AI Problems

How do we design AI agents to address the characteristics?

## Properties of AI agent

## What is Knowledge-Based AI?

![deliberation](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-4679740f367a3801.png)

* Reasoning, learning, and memory are closely interactive with each other and form a system called "deliberation", with is part of the cognitive system.

Thinking-acting spectrum and optimal-like human spectrum

## What are Cognitive Systems?

![Definition of Cognitive Systems](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-7433f16652edb561.png)

* The definition indicates that cognitive systems are in the quadrants on the left side of the spectrum.

Percepts of the worlds go into Cognitive Systems as inputs via sensors and Cognitive systems give output with (???).


![Multiple Cognitive Systems](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-793e7fde5766ed4d.png)

* Cognitive Systems interact with the world and other Cognitive Systems.

three-layer architecture.
* reactive system.
* deliberation
* Metacognition

## Final quiz: What have I learned from this class.

![final quiz](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-22927a3d1f1d211b.png)

> In this course, I learned the characteristics of AI agent, AI problems, and major conundrums of AI. All the AI agents have limited computational resources, sensors attention, or knowledge and the logic they use is deductive. While the problems that AI needs to solve
are dynamic, open-ended and often computationally intractable.

> There are four schools of AI based the optimally-human-like spectrum and thinking-acting spectrum. Cognitive systems are more human-like.

> The cognitive system have three modules: creative, deliberation, and metacognition. and in deliberation, there are three modules: reasoning, Learning, and Memory.
