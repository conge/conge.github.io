# 01 - Technical versus fundamental analysis
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-a36ac8be1c537a46.png)

Two broad categories of approaches to use for choosing stocks to buy or sell: __Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis__

__Fundamental analysis__:  looking at aspects of a company to estimate its value and look for the price < value situations.
* earnings, dividends, cash flow, book value  

__Technical analysis__: Looking for patterns or trends in a stock's price.

# 02 - Characteristics
__Characteristics of technical analysis__
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-3e17ab812194b2d8.png)

1. it looks only at price and volume.
2. compute statistics (or indicators) on this time series
  * __Indicators__ are heuristics that may hint at a buy or sell opportunity.

__Criticism of the technical approach__
* it's not an appropriate method for investing, because it's not considering the value of the companies.
* trading approach as opposed to an investing approach.

__Reasons to believe technical analysis__
* there is indeed information in price and information in a price change.
* Stock price and price change reflects sentiments of buyers and sellers
* in other domains of artificial intelligence, heuristics can work, and they work frequently.

# 03 - Quiz: Potential indicators
__Look at each one of these four factors and fill in the box, T for technical or F for fundamental.__
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-2f575635c6db7216.png)

* the moving average of price is only using price [technical.]
* Percent change in volume is only using volume [technical].
* price/earnings, earning is a fundamental factor, which makes the whole [fundamental].
* intrinsic value is based on dividends [a fundamenta]

# 04 - When is technical analysis valuable
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-5fb7a31629bde0ad.png)


1. individual indicators, by themselves, are weakly predictive. And the more people following a particular approach, the less value is realized
2. combining multiple indicators adds value. Combinations of three to five different indicators, in a machine learning context, provide a much stronger predictive system
3. contrasts. If certain stocks are behaving differently than the market, then they are worth a further look.
4. technical analysis generally works better over shorter time periods.

# 05 - When is technical analysis valuable part 2

__The trading horizon__

__For fundamental factors__: Over long periods of time, fundamental factors provide a lot of value.

* For trading machines on the stock exchange, the order book or momentum, etc really matter, and the fundamental factors really have low value.
* fundamental factors over long periods of time may have significant value.
* over a period of days, Fundamental factors do have value.

__for technical factors__.

* over long terms technical analysis is not so valuable.
* technical factors potentially have high value over very short periods of time.

__decision complexity__

* Computer-based trading
  * we have to be able to make the decisions really, really fast if we're trading at the millisecond level.
  * at this very high-frequency trading, the complexity of decisions is simple. And computers excel in this region of the chart.

  * the high-frequency trading computer-driven hedge funds are short in the trading horizon.

* human investors
  * we can take a long time to make a decision if we're going to buy and hold for years.
  * If taking a long time to make a decision, it is the best region for human investors.
  * The insight-driven, human-based hedge funds are operating over a long trading horizon.
* there is a middle where we often see humans and computers working together.

# 06 - A few indicators: Momentum

Three are some of the most common and most popular indicators: 1) momentum, 2( simple moving average, and 3) Bollinger Bands.

__momentum__

![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-ad2dcc32ef833497.png)

Momentum is over some number of days how much has the price changed: __positive momentum__ and __negative momentum__

* The steepness of that line is the strength of the momentum, either positive or negative.

* convert numbers   
momentum, N days of momentum.

* the pseudo code for how we compute momentum on a particular day. `momentum[t] = price[t]/price[t - n] -1`, n is the number of days between two time point.

# 07 - A few indicators: Simple moving average (SMA).
![image.png](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-2bce55cafa7c4467.png)

* SMA for today is simply the average of the values over this look back window.
* the SMA looks essentially like a smoothed value of the price chart as it moves around.
* SMA lags the movement.

__two different ways that technicians use simple moving average__

1. look for where the current price crosses through the simple moving average.
* combine that with momentum: the price has strong momentum, and it's crossing through that simple moving average, that can be a signal.

* strong momentum crossing those lines, then again, that can be a trading signal.

2. simple moving average is as a proxy for underlying value.
* The average price might represent the true value of the company.
* we should expect that the price is eventually going to regress to that average. ( it's an arbitrage opportunity)

__quantify SMA__

* compare the current price with the current simple moving average, and construct a ratio.
* `SMA[t] = price[n]/price[t-n:t].mean() -1`
* This value ranges from -50% to +50%.

# 08 - A few indicators Bollinger Bands
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-608f9d6e22e21405.png)

__how much of an excursion from the simple moving average should I use as a signal for a buy or sell?__

* a fixed number is probably not the best way to go.
* John Bollinger observed that for low volatility, use a smaller excursion for that trigger. For high volatility, use a larger number.
* __the Bollinger Bands__: take this simple moving average, but let's add a band above and below 2 std (standard deviations).

__How might we use Bollinger Bands now for trading signals__

* look for times where the price's outside one of these Bollinger Bands and when it crosses to the inside it should be a trading signal.
* Moving from above the band and cross to the inside, __selling signal__
* Moving from below the band and cross to the inside, __buying signal__

__How to calculate the Bollinger Band on a particular day t__

* `BB[t] = (Price[t] -SMA[t]) / (2*std[t])`
* BB[t] = -1 or BB[t] = 1 are the crossing point.
* BB[t -1] > 1and BB[t] = 1 and BB[t+1] > 1, then Sell
*  BB[t -1] < -1and BB[t] = -1 and BB[t+1] <- 1, then buy
*  typically expect to BB[t] is between -1 and 1.
* occasionally, we'll see excursions above and below those values.

# 09 - Buy or sell
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-7401061378f48fc0.png)

In the four different times where the actual price crosses and upper or lower Bollinger band. Is it a buy signal, a sell signal or no signal at all?

The solution: is in the picture: remember, only when price moves into the Bollinger Band is a trading signal. Moving outside is not.

# 10 - Normalization
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-ffd0b252cbca8a3d.png)

* Simple moving average and momentum are bouned in [-.5, +.5] and Bollinger bands in [-1, 1].
* When used in a machine learner Bollinger Band factor would tend to overwhelm these other factors and [falsely] become the most important one.
* It might get even worse if we included fundamental factor like PE ratio ranges in [1, 300]

The solution: __normalization__.

Given values, the normalization works this way:
* `normalized_values = [values - mean(values)] / std(values)`
*  normalized_values will range in [-1, 1] and have a mean of 0.

__⚠️!!Normalize your data if use indicators in machine learning models!!__

# 11 - Wrap up
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-152bab9e64d0e0ae.png)

1. technical indicators are really heuristics that represent how a statistical approach to previous __prices__ and __volume__ might suggest future price movement.

2. Tucker's approach of using Bollinger Band.
