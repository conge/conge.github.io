## 1 - Overview
![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-fcc559200b79b358.png)

Q-learning is expensive because it takes many experienced tuples to converge. Creating experienced tuples means taking a real step to execute a trade, in order to gather information.

To address this problem, Rich Sutton invented Dyna.
* Dyna models T (the transition matrix) and R (the reward matrix).
* after each real interaction with the world, we hallucinate many additional interactions, usually a few hundred that are used then to update the queue table.

## 2 - Dyna-Q Big Picture
![image.png](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-34bcde42a5f9da40.png)

Q learning is model-free meaning that it does not rely on T or R.
* Q learning does not know T or R.
* T = transition matrix and R = reward function,

Dyna-Q is an algorithm developed by Rich Sutton intended to speed up learning or model convergence for Q learning.

Dyna is a blend of model-free and model-based methods.

1.  first consider plain old Q learning, initialize our Q table and then we begin iterating, observe `s`,  take action  `a`, and then observe our new state `s' and reward `r`, and then update Q table with this experience tubal and repeat.
2. when we augment Q learning with Dyna-Q, we had three new components, the first is that we add some "logic that enables us to learn models of T and R", then we hallucinate an experience.
* hallucinate these experiences, update our queue table and repeat this many times, maybe hundreds of times.
* This operation is very cheap compared to interacting with the real world.
* After we've iterated enough times down here maybe 100 maybe 200 times then we return and resume our interaction with the real world.

### Let's look at each of these components in a little more detail now.

When updating our model we want to do is find new values for T and R.

The point where we update our model includes T,  our reward function R.
* T is the probability that if we are in state s and we take action a will end up in s prime.
*  r is our expected reward if we are in state s and we take action a.

### how we hallucinate an experience.

1. randomly select an `s`, 
2. randomly select an `a`, so our state and action are chosen totally at random.
3. infer our new state `s'` by looking at T.
4. we infer a reward `r` by looking at big R or R table.

Now we have a complete experience tuple to update our Q table using that.

So, the Q table update is our final step and this is really all there is to die in a queue.

## 3 - Learning T

Note the methods are Balch version, might not be Rich Sutton version.

__Learning T__.

T[s,a,s'] represents the __probability__ that if we are in the state `s`, take action `a` we will end up in state `s'`.

To learn a model of T: just observe how these transitions occur.
* T count (TC): when we have experience with the real world, we'll get back on <s,a,s'> and we'll just count how many times did it happen.
*  initialize all of our T count values to be a very, very small number to avoid number divided by zero.
* Each time we interact with the real world in Q-learning, we observe <s,a,r,s'>, then we just increment that location in our T-count matrix.

> *Time: 00:01:34*

## 4 - How to Evaluate T

$T[s,a,s'] = \frac{T_c[s,a,s']}{\sum\limits_{i}T_c[s,a,i]} $

## 6 - Learning R

![](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-35b5c686e6ab8da7.png)

The last step here is how do we learn a model for R?

* When we execute an action `a` in state `s`, we get an immediate reward, `r`.

* R[s, a] are expected reward if we're in state s and we execute action a.
* R is our model,  `r`  is what we get in an experience tuple.
* update R model every time we have a real experience.
* $ R'[s,a] = (1 - \alpha) R[s,a] + \alpha \times r$.
* `r` is the new estimate.
That's a simple way to build a model of R from observations of interactions with the real world.

## 7 - Dyna Q Recap

__how Dyna-Q works.__

![ ](/assets/images/计算机科学/118382-06637bf88676f6e0.png)

 Dyna-Q adds three new components based on regular Q-Learning

1. update models of T and R, 
2. then we hallucinate an experience.
3. update our Q table.

We can repeat 2-3 many times. ~100 or 200 here, then return back up to the top and continue our interaction with the real world.

* The reason Dyna-Q is useful: use cheap hallucinations to replace real-world interaction (which is expensive)

* And when we iterate doing many of them, we _update our Q table much more quickly_.

## Summary

The Dyna architecture consists of a combination of:

- direct reinforcement learning from real experience tuples gathered by acting in an environment,
- updating an internal model of the environment, and,
- using the model to simulate experiences.
