<p>This week I visited CVS twice on 8/6 and 8/7. </p>  <p>The first time I got Colgate toothpaste, Gillette razor and two Sobe Life water ($16 tag price), used $6.75 coupon and $7.99 ECB. Paid<strong> 0.98 out of pocket</strong> and got 7.00 ECB.</p>  <p>Then I found out I was about to be out of Vitamin C. I found out CVS has Ester-C BOGO and I had 2 $3/1 coupons. I just cannot miss this deal. So came the second trip to CVS. This time I got 2 bottles of Ester-C and another Colgate toothpaste ($24.57 tag price), used $6 coupon and&#160; $8 ECB. Paid<strong> $0.74</strong> out of pocket and got another $2 ECB to roll next week.</p>  <p>So, two trips to CVS, got $40.58 worth of product. Paid $1.72 out of pocket.</p>  <p>Good deal!</p>  <p>The trip to Rite Aid was also fun except that I forgot to spend my UPRs. Have to spend them next week.</p>  <p>At Rite Aid, I got $38.45 worth of product, used $15.25 coupons, paid $20.89 out of pocket and earned 6.55 UPRs + $10.99 SCR.</p>
