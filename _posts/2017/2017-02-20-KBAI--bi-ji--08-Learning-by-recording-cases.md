* the new problem is to find the route from Q to the arrow pointed destination.
* D is the correct answer since it starts close to Q and ends close to the arrow

When there are K dimensions of elements, the formula needs to be generalized.
__Limitation of the method__:
1. in real life, N can be really large
2. the nearest method might be the great solution.
